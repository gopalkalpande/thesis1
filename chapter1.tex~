Social networks are modeled as graphs in which nodes represent the individuals and edges represent interactions between  nodes. Many problems have been proposed on social networks regarding influence maximization \cite{influencemaximization}, community discovery \cite{M.E.J.Newman}, influence spread \cite{influencespread} etc. These problems have been found to have many applications to real-world problems like finding the pathways of virus spread, to find influential customers in the online marketing scenario, to find groups of nodes that share common properties etc. In this thesis we are interested in exploring the  community discovery algorithms with special focus on overlapping communities. It should be noted that community discovery problem is NP-hard \cite{nphardurl}.

\section{Community}

	A community in a social network is loosely defined as a group of nodes which have dense connections within and sparse external connections with the rest of the graph.

	\label{fig:communities}
	\end{center}
	
	In  the above figure we can observe that, there are three communities with dotted lines which are connected densely within the community than outside the community.
	
\section{Overlapping Community}

	Overlapping community \cite{overlapdefinition} can be defined as nodes which belong to more than one community falling in the overlapping regions between communities. To discover these overlapping nodes is the problem of overlapping community detection.
	
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm,height=7cm]{figures/overlap.png}		
		\captionof{figure}{Network with communities and overlapping nodes}
		\label{fig:overlapcommunities}
	\end{center}
	
	In the above figure we can observe that  there are four communities exists in blue, green, pink and yellow colour boundaries. There are some nodes in red colour, they have approximately equal connections with other communities as well. That means they belong to both the communities, these nodes are considered as overlapping nodes.
	
\section{Motivation}
	The existing algorithms for community discovery in the literature retrieves disjoint communities. On the other hand, in reality, many people (nodes) belong to more than one community. For example, in Social Networks there are groups of people or entities who share some common properties, that may be friendship, organization, research etc. and further who have membership in more than one community.  Overlapping community discovery may be  used 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item to find groups of people having diverse interests.
		\item to find nodes with  connections to different clusters in the network.
		\item to find groups of pages of World Wide Web which correspond to inter-disciplinary topics.
	\end{itemize} 
	
\section{Overview of Project Report}
		
	In chapter 2, we discuss background and literature survey for community discovery and overlapping community discovery. We described about centrality measures, degree centrality and betweenness centrality, then we discuss measures like modularity, conductance, etc. These parameters are used in community  discovery algorithms. We described some of the available community discovery algorithms. Finally we summarize three overlapping community discovery papers briefly.
	
	In chapter 3, we propose two  algorithms for overlapping community discovery based on the idea of  consensus clustering.  First algorithm tries to detect the cores of the communities based on consensus of  existing community discovery algorithms in the literature and depicts the rest of the nodes as overlapping communities. The second algorithm proposes that usually overlapping nodes are connected to more than one community and hence analysis of the neighbourhood of a node will be useful in determining if it is an overlapping node. These two algorithms are given and explained using a small  benchmark dataset called Zachary karate club network.
	
	In chapter 4, implementation and results  of the proposed algorithms are presented on various benchmark datasets and synthetic datasets. We test the algorithms on three benchmark datasets namely, Zachary, Dolphin and Collaboration networks and three synthetic datasets Synthetic dataset, Shiva-Gopi facebook data, Shiva-Swayam facebook network. The construction of these  datasets and  sources is explained briefly. Results of the  algorithms in terms of the  number of communities and modularity values are given. Overlapping communities detected by the two algorithms are compared and analysed.
	
	In Chapter 5, we conclude the thesis and discuss other  applications of overlapping community discovery.
