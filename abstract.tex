%\section{Abstract}
Inter dependence of financial markets around the globe is well established. The same has exposed the banks to various risks. The objective of the project is to study ALM in banks and to minimize financial risks. Asset and liability management is an important problem in finance, which mainly focuses on controlling the liquidity risk and interest rate risk.\\

The First chapter of the thesis covers the risks associated with banks, ALM process as per the guidelines of RBI, project objectives, problem statement and the detailed literature survey with explanation of background topics . The thesis mainly focuses on the simulation of ALM problem for banks which will be discussed in chapter 2, LPP formulation for optimization of assets discussed in chapter 3 and prediction of stock price using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) neural network discussed in chapter 4. The chapter 5 contains the conclusion of the thesis and future work.

%As part of these projects we expect the students to develop some of the existing schemes and, if possible, to come up with new schemes realizing the compartmented access structures.
