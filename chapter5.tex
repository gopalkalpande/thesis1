The work done in this thesis tries to solve ALM problem for bank. The second chapter simulates the ALM environment of the bank and gives the brief understanding of the concept. 
It also gives nice insights from the data which can be utilized for maximizing profit.\\

The third chapter discusses the single objective optimization method for liquidity risk management using Linear Programming Formulation using objective function as maximizing the profit of the bank.\\

The third chapter makes an attempt to predict the stock price of the particular stock based on it's historical values using the novelty of the deep learning techniques. The LSTM model trained on the data completely outperforms the traditional statistical models.
