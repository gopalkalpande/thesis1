\section{Conclusion}

The work done in this thesis tries to solve ALM problem for bank. The second chapter simulates the ALM environment of the bank and gives the brief understanding of the concept. 
It also gives nice insights from the data which can be utilized for maximizing profit.\\

The third chapter discusses the single objective optimization method for liquidity risk management using Linear Programming Formulation using objective function as maximizing the profit of the bank.\\

The fourth chapter makes an attempt to predict the stock price of the particular stock based on it's historical values using the novelty of the deep learning techniques. The LSTM model trained on the data completely outperforms the traditional statistical models.

\section{Future Work}

The single objective linear optimization can be updated by multi objective optimization and non linear optimization. A fuzzy controller can be formulated for the same purpose. \\

The LSTM model can be replaced by attention based models, dual attention based models and also with Multi input based models. For creating features the stastical approaches can be used as Moving Average, moving average convergence divergence (MACD), Momentum, Relative Strength Index, Average Directional Index, etc. \\
