The single objective linear optimization can be updated by multi objective optimization and non linear optimization. A fuzzy controller can be formulated for the same purpose. \\

The LSTM model can be replaced by attention based models, dual attention based models and also with Multi input based models. For creating features the stastical approaches can be used as Moving Average, moving average convergence divergence (MACD), Momentum, Relative Strength Index, Average Directional Index, etc. \\
