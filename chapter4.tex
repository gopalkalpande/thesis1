The work done in this thesis tries to solve ALM problem for bank. The second chapter discusses the single objective optimization method for liquidity risk management using Linear Programming Formulation using objective function as mazimizing the profit of the bank and various time bucket constraints and interest rates respective to that bucket.\\

The third chapter makes an attempt to predict the stock price of the perticular stock based on it's hitorical values using the novelty of the deep learning techniques. The LSTM model trained on the data completely outperforms the traditional stastical models.
