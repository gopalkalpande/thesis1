This package provides two environments, "algorithmic" and
"algorithm", which are designed to be used together but may 
be used separately. The "algorithmic" environment provides 
an environment for describing algorithms and the "algorithm" 
environment provides a "float" wrapper for algorithms 
(implemented using "algorithmic" or some other method at 
the author's option).  The reason that two environments are 
provided is to allow the author maximum flexibility.
